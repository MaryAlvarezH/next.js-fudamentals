This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

# Summary
Next.js is an open source framework build on top Node.js enabling React based web application functionalities:
- Fast refresh
- File system routing
- Client-side navigation with `<Link></>` tag where page transition is using JS which is faster than the default  navigation donde by the browser
- Code splitting and prefetching (based on file system routing and client-side navigation)

# Next Components
- `<Link></>` 
    - For client-side navigation and code prefetching

- `<Image></>`
    Useful to:
    - Resizing, optimizing and serving images in morder formays like WebP
    - Responsive images
    - Optimization on-demand in order to avoid increase build time
    - Lazy loaded by defeault. Images load as they're scrolled into viewport

- `<Head></Head>`
    - Allows modify metadata of the page


# Styling
Next.js uses a "CSS-in-JS" library called styled-jsx -it lets you write CSS ithin React component (styles scoped where other components won't be affected).

It has build-in support for CSS and Sass

### CSS Modules
It automatically generates unique class names
1. Create a module.scss file and add the styles
2. Import the styles in the React component using `import styles from './file-name.module.css'`
3. Use `className` attribute on the tag

Next.jsâ€™s code splitting feature works on CSS Modules as well. It ensures the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for each page. This results in smaller bundle sizes.

### Global Styles
Global styles can only be adding in `pages/_app.js` file and the content of this file must be similar to:
```
import '../styles/global.css'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```
